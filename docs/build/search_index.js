In more mathematical terms: suppose we are attempting to optimize a function  f(p), but each calculation of  f is very expensive. It may be the case we need to solve a PDE for each point or use advanced numerical linear algebra machinery which is usually costly. The idea is then to develop a surrogate model  g which approximates  f by training on previous data collected from evaluations of  f. The construction of a surrogate model can be seen as a three steps process:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"Sample selection\nConstruction of the surrogate model\nSurrogate optimization","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"The sampling methods are super important for the behaviour of the Surrogate.
